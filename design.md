##COLOR PALETTE

- (BLUE)#55acee - patience, trust, stability, professionalism, trust, honor,
  color of the Pacific Ocean and color of Spongebob's political party
- (ORANGE)#ff9a01 - draws attention, cheerfulness and creativity

##BUTTONS

Big buttons, capitalized text, and bright colors are used to engage those
viewing the page, so that they can subscribe to the news letter, read on more
about a news article and navigate the site with ease.

##IMAGES

All images were converted to a file type that'll allow for faster load times.
This will help load images quicker with slower internet.

##NAVBAR/FOOTER

On desktop view, the navigation includes general categories. When hovered on,
a drop down menu will open with sub categories where users can learn more about
Spongebob. This tactic was used to minimize clutter and maximize user visibility
of the intended initial view on initial load.

On mobile view, the navigation is compacted into a menu that'll allow for a pop
up window. Once clicked on, users will see a drop down menu with "main"
categories (DARK BLUE) and sub categories (LIGHT BLUE). This approach is used so
that the navigational items won't take up space, thus allowing users to see the
Jumbotron, text and social media items on initial load.

Both views include a white border on the bottom of the navbars for a smoother
transition from the navbar to the jumbotron image

##JUMBOTON

On desktop view, a large, vivid image is shown with different color variations
that corresponds with the main color palette. There are two focal points to the
jumbotron.

  1) Spongebob's image
  2) Spongebob's name and title

Everything except the two are blurred out, so that users are instantly drawn on
who and what this website is about immediately.

On mobile view, the image is darkened so the image's bright colors doesn't
clutter the initial view. This asserts a primary focal point that SPONGEBOB
SQUAREPANTS IS A PACIFIC OCEAN SENATOR and social media resources to learn more
about Spongebob's social media presence

##SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS

On desktop view, the social media icons lay on the bottom of the initial view
underneath the jumbotron with a white background. This helps the entity to stand
out without over-cluttering the initial view of the page.

On mobile view, the icons are included within the jumbotron. Since mobile views
are limiting on what can be shown, the icons are placed on top of jumbotron.
Additionally, the darkened image helps to increase visibility without the need
of increasing the size of icons/using effects that'll take more time to load.

##TWITTER FEED

On desktop view, Spongebob's image is placed next to a tweet he sent out. The
image is placed next to the tweet to help increase a more personalized feeling
with the contents of the tweet with Spongebob.

On mobile view, the twitter feed is shown after the jumbotron. The circular
image was removed so that the tweet would take up the rest of the space on
initial view reducing clutter. The contents of the jumbotron and replaces the
need for circular image of Spongebob. Looking at the intiial view, users can
feel the continuity between the tweet and Spongebob.

##NEWS FEED

On desktop view, a dark blue heading is used for a subtle look with the grey
background. When hovering headlines, the text turns orange. Also a big blue
button is directly underneath the article. Both are used to iterate to users that
it is a clickable link that leads to more content. Articles are sectioned off
into 3 even squares for continuity between articles.

On mobile view, the articles are encapsulated within a rectangular box to group
the articles together as a section. Additionally, orange and blue are used
in the headlines and buttons in an alternating manner to better differentiate
articles. Additionally, articles are stacked on top of each other rather than
side by side to allow for better legibility

On both views, Articles will include:

1) Spongebob's name
2) An assertive action
3) A plan plan/topic he is fighting for

Reading this encourages viewers that Spongebob is actively working towards a
representing others. A grey background is used to separate the social
media/twitter section and office location section.

##OFFICE LOCATION

On desktop view, images are sectioned off with even widths to for easier viewing
between office locations.

On mobile view, locations are stacked on top of each other for easier viewing.
